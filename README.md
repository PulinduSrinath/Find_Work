🚀 Find Work | Mobile App to Connect Clients & Skilled Workers
"The work you’re looking for is closer than you think."
Simplifying how people find trustworthy workers and how workers find reliable jobs — locally, easily, and quickly.

🔧 About The Project
Find Work is a smart solution for daily workers and clients. Whether you're looking for a house cleaner, plumber, coconut tree climber, or babysitter — or you’re someone with these skills looking for job opportunities — this app connects you instantly.

The app was born out of a simple realization:
Many people are searching for work, and many people need workers. They just can't find each other at the right time.
We solve this problem through location-based matching, profile ratings, and direct communication.

✨ Key Features
✅ Live Map Integration: See available jobs or workers around you in real-time.

✅ Worker Profiles: List your skills and build your reputation through client feedback.

✅ Client Dashboards: Post jobs, review applicants, and pick trusted workers.

✅ Direct Communication: Chat within the app or contact directly via phone.

✅ Smart Search & Filters: Find exactly what you need — by skill, budget, availability, and rating.

✅ Secure & Reliable: Data privacy and user protection with Firebase backend and authentication.
