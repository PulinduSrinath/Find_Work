## 🔧 About The Project

Every day, people are in need of trustworthy workers — house cleaners, plumbers, coconut tree climbers, babysitters, and more. At the same time, countless skilled individuals are actively seeking work. The problem? They can't seem to find each other when it matters most.

**Find Work** was built to solve this problem using:
- 📍 **Location-based matching**
- 🌟 **Reputation-based worker profiles**
- 💬 **Direct communication between clients and workers**

Whether you're a worker looking to find more jobs or a client trying to find someone reliable, **Find Work** simplifies the process.
